# Separate on-demand banks — 15 September 2026

- Production emits `banks/puzzles-<hash>.txt`, `banks/exam-<hash>.txt` and `banks/python-<hash>.txt`; the app bundle contains URLs and the loader, not bank payloads. Relative URLs work under the repository Pages path.
- Selecting an activity or entering a code fetches only its bank. Display data is reused in memory; answer payloads remain encoded until checking/reveal. An active saved attempt loads its bank on startup; a fresh home/progress page loads none.
- Failed fetches/decodes can be retried; saved attempts are preserved after a network error. Concurrent requests share one download. Content/code revisions are unchanged by this packaging change.
- 57 Node tests pass, including separate-artifact and loader/cache/retry checks. Production browser checks pass, including saved attempts, codes and progress imports. Changes are local, not deployed.

# Local implementation checkpoint — 15 September 2026

- Four-hour gap from the last completed attempt to the next tracked start for the same exact set; timer/order ignored, permutations distinct. Early practice scores are shown without changing progress; recent practice dates are included in JSON backups. Legacy tracked attempts keep their status.
- Applied classroom review to 52 exam parts in both variations and further wording/accepted-answer fixes. The encoding layout and slots are unchanged. The teacher agreed to selective compatibility: content revision 3 accepts the 344 unchanged revision-2 variations and rejects the 73 altered ones. Updated example: BoAkAiAg. Use codes:update after future content edits; docs/build-only changes do not affect revisions.
- Build uses pinned esbuild and fflate: compressed/Base64 display banks with a reversible 17-position alphabet rotation, separate per-part marking and reveal payloads, and a separately encoded Go playing tree. No plaintext authoring banks or source maps in `_site`; authoring files remain in Git. Decoding is temporary and model explanations are decoded only for reveal.
- Use `npm ci` then `npm start` to build and serve `_site`. Serving repository-root HTML is no longer the preview workflow. CI installs JavaScript dependencies before validation/build.
- 55 Node tests pass, covering packed/source parity, production artifacts, selective code compatibility, four-hour boundaries and marking alternatives. Browser checks pass against the built site; validate/build pass. These changes are local and have not been deployed by the assistant.

# GitHub Pages is live

- Published at https://jhudshcg.github.io/starters/ from `jhudshcg/starters`, branch `main`.
- Enabled Pages with `build_type: workflow`. The existing build passed; rerunning the failed deployment succeeded (run 34796389719, attempt 2).
- Verified public HTTP 200 and the Joe Hudson footer credit. Future pushes to `main` run validation and deploy automatically.

# Publish checkpoint — 14 September 2026

This section supersedes the historical snapshots below.

- Ready for the user to publish to GitHub. Pages Actions workflow validates and packages browser assets, then deploys successful `main` builds. No remote is configured locally; the user is creating the repository. Select Settings → Pages → Source → GitHub Actions, then push `main` or run the workflow manually.
- Current bank: **178 templates / 417 variations**: **115 puzzles**, **51 exam questions**, **12 Python challenges**. Normal puzzle sets contain **three** distinct questions of one subtype; individual question codes still open one. Existing revision-2 slots remain stable.
- All **30 maths source ideas** are in the live classic maths bank, with source IDs and counts in the JSON inventory. Concise adaptations repair ambiguous source rules. Coin-system and arithmetic-expression marking accepts valid alternatives without executing input.
- **50 Go problems** imported: 49 attributed GoProblems examples plus OGS 2625. Original board sizes, setup, captures and supplied branches are preserved. The import/validation tool uses pinned sgfmill 1.1.1. All **1,528 recorded positions** pass legality/capture checks. Winning outcomes rely on source annotations; unlisted moves remain explicitly unverified. Ko and seki are identified in relevant prompts.
- Go UX: click/keyboard play, immediate visible opponent stone and captures, alternative recorded replies, Undo/Reset, persistent next-move hints counted as assisted, and immediate green success feedback. Removed redundant automatic-reply wording. Solution replay supports actual dragging without replacing the slider node during input.
- Six new coding templates, five variations each: functions, returns, scope, bounds, binary/linear search and bubble-sort passes. Python now has four selectable focuses. Existing CA1/CA2 content was not changed in this batch; the user will provide feedback later.
- Footer includes “designed by Joe Hudson”.
- Browser smoke passed: all nine puzzle subtypes, three-puzzle sets, new coding focuses, Go stone visibility/hints/reload/drag replay/success feedback, existing path/tangram interactions, score placement, timer recovery and 320px reflow. An earlier coding-focus failure disappeared after a fresh browser load with caching disabled.
- Final local checks: 33 Node tests passed; all model answers and coverage report passed; Go tree validation passed. All 150 grid/geometry variations passed independent validation and the static site build succeeded.
- The user wants concise progress updates and quick completion; do not leave long silent periods while testing. Public deployment itself has not been verified.

# Current checkpoint — 14 September 2026

This section supersedes the earlier session snapshots below.

## Deployment and maths collection follow-up

- Corrected scope: all 30 Mr Barton Maths problems are requested, exempt from the five-per-type limit. All prompts were read, but only five are integrated; the remaining 25 are unfinished work. `data/coverage/classic-maths-inventory.json` tracks every source ID, live bank slots and known authoring issues. Do not describe this collection as completed.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` validates and packages the site on pull requests and deploys successful `main` builds through GitHub Pages. `npm run build` creates `_site` from browser assets only.
- No GitHub remote was configured at setup time. Repository URL and the repository’s Pages source setting are still needed before public deployment can be verified.

## Ready for local testing

- Preview: http://127.0.0.1:8765. Prefer VS Code’s integrated browser. An isolated Chrome profile was used for automated tests because no VS Code browser tool was available.
- 97 templates / 312 variations across the app: **40 puzzles**, **51 exam questions**, **6 Python questions**.
- Puzzles: eight subtypes with five distinct puzzles each — logic grids, logic equations, tangrams, cover-every-dot paths, Sudoku, arithmetic cages, sequences and classic maths. Original templates have five variations; the five classic problems are fixed. Each subtype has its own file in `data/puzzles/`, imported by `data/puzzles.js`. One substantial puzzle per activity, with a provisional 5–15-minute duration.
- Exam: every CA1–CA2 subsection is selectable, with three multipart questions per activity (currently 15–16 marks). `data/exam.js` imports CA1 and CA2 files. Term aliases and simple sentence wrappers are supported; code fragments are compared by tokens, preserving case and string contents, without execution.
- Coverage: `data/coverage/core-inventory.json` contains 106 official focuses / **369 subelements**, with permanent letters. Parts link to `{focus, elements}`; display notation is `CA2.1.1[a,b]`. Generated report: **239 elements with a qualifying live question**, **10 with two live questions**, **10 supporting-practice-only**, **120 uncovered**, **0 teacher-approved complete**. Do not present topic-level or live counts as full reviewed coverage. Run `npm run coverage` after edits; validation rejects stale reports.
- Bank revision **2** replaces the demo bank at the user’s request. Old demo codes are rejected rather than mapped to different content. History is retained; unsupported unfinished activities are cleared. The eight-character Base64url format is unchanged.

## Latest puzzle interaction decisions

- Paths have **no fixed start or endpoint**. Choose any open dot. Press and drag while held; snap through adjacent tracks, release to stop, and press the endpoint to resume. Backtracking removes the later route. Click and keyboard alternatives remain. All open dots must be visited exactly once; no blocked dots, jumps or diagonals. Accept any valid route, including reversed solutions. Every obstacle layout has a checked complete witness route.
- Logic and equation grids cycle unknown → × excluded → ✓ selected. Persist candidate notes and Undo history. Yellow means selected, not correct.
- Sudoku and arithmetic cages use directly selected cells, digit buttons, keyboard input and pencil notes. Givens are immutable; large boards scroll within their region at high zoom.
- Tangrams use seven geometric pieces with click placement, half-unit movement, ±45° rotation and parallelogram flipping. Check geometric coverage and overlap, accepting alternative tilings. The 25 supplied silhouettes are distinct even after rotation/reflection. Piece dragging is not implemented; all placement operations work by click/keyboard.
- Keep Show hint visible and checking/reveal in the existing disclosure. Solutions remain hidden until requested. Results appear beside Submit and at the top.
- Each subtype now has its own format, approach, presentation and marking section in `docs/spec-puzzles.md`.

## Source review and boundaries

- Inspected all nine images in `example_puzzles`, including the easy and harder logic grids, equations, tangram, dot path and Sudoku. The under-one-minute basic example is onboarding, not the difficulty benchmark.
- Read all 30 prompts embedded in the linked Mr Barton Maths HTML. The page has self-reported completion, no answer key or automatic marking. Found ambiguous/mistaken wording, including reversed information assignments in the birthday puzzle. The five imported classic ideas use concise adapted wording, source links and independently checked explanations, rather than copying the entire collection.
- Sampled the linked Mathschallenge PDF; did not claim to review all 127 pages. Questions and solutions share pages and must be separated if used.
- Go remains the optional separate extension. GoProblems/OGS links exposed app shells through the reader; positions and ranks were not verified. No Go puzzles are claimed implemented.

## Verification completed

- **28 automated tests passed**, covering codes, set selection, marking/negation/code tokens, coverage counting and variation requirements, puzzle constraints, alternative paths/tilings, and independently calculated classic answers.
- Bank validation passed for all 97 templates / 312 variations. Generated coverage files are current.
- `python3 scripts/validate-puzzles.py` independently checked all **150 served grid/geometry variations**, including unique logic/equation solutions, Sudoku uniqueness and deduction traces, cage uniqueness, feasible routes and exact lattice tangram coverage.
- Browser smoke passed: exam input/scoring and subelement references; candidate states and Undo; Sudoku notes and reload; real continuous mouse dragging from an arbitrary path start; tangram click placement/rotation and reveal; all eight subtypes; timer recovery; 320px reflow. Screenshots: `/private/tmp/starters-*.png`.

## Next priorities

1. Teacher review the new puzzle difficulty and run mixed-ability timing trials; solver checks do not establish challenge level. Sequences and some equation boards may particularly need calibration.
2. Review the subelement inventory and direct-assessment mappings, then fill the generated coverage gaps. Add a second distinct question and two applicable variations per element; do not bulk-mark current content approved.
3. Further improve short-description marking and misconception feedback. Current text rules are deliberately bounded; unrestricted semantic marking is not implemented.
4. Optional later work: Go, tangram dragging, more advanced Sudoku techniques, richer linked explanations, CSV import and broader Python challenges. No public deployment performed.

# Session checkpoint · 13 September 2026

## Read this first: puzzle difficulty is still inadequate

Latest teacher feedback:

> “those spatial challenges are barely any more challenging. I suppose I'll need to find some examples for you. and in general the challenges for all puzzles needs to be raised, so T-Level students can be kept busy thinking for 5-15 minutes.”

This applies to **all puzzle families**, not only spatial reasoning. The recent multi-step spatial replacements did not meet the intended difficulty. Do not interpret earlier positive feedback on the app as approval of puzzle difficulty. The interface is testable; the educational challenge still needs substantial work.

- Target: year 1 Digital Software Development T-Level students, generally 16–18, mixed experience. A starter set should sustain meaningful thinking for 5–15 minutes.
- Current duration labels are estimates, not validated student completion times. Passing automated checks establishes functional correctness, not age-appropriate challenge or engagement.
- Adding a few transformations or more clicks did not solve the difficulty problem. Future tasks need stronger reasoning demands, such as linked deductions, planning, interacting constraints or evaluation of alternatives. These are design directions, not agreed example puzzles.
- The teacher may bring examples to establish the intended level. No examples have been supplied yet. Use them to calibrate puzzle structure, difficulty and timing before producing another large bank of similarly simple tasks.
- Latest request is to save this checkpoint for the next session. No further puzzle redesign was requested for the remainder of this session.

## Recommended next-session starting point

1. Read this checkpoint, [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), and any new teacher examples or instructions.
2. Identify what makes the examples demanding: deductions needed, constraints that interact, planning depth, plausible wrong approaches and expected solving time.
3. Develop a small number of representative puzzles at the intended level and make them testable for teacher review before generating many variations. If examples are still unavailable, acknowledge that difficulty calibration remains unresolved rather than claiming the existing puzzles now meet the target.
4. Preserve the interface improvements below. Increase intellectual difficulty without adding confusing controls, unnecessary reading or repetitive clicking.
5. Validate solvability, solution uniqueness where required, acceptance of alternative valid answers and marking; then use student/teacher trials to assess the 5–15-minute target.

## Current working application

Static SPA, no installation/build step required for browser use. Local preview:

`http://127.0.0.1:8765`

If it is not running, start from the project root:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

The server was running at the end of development; do not assume that process survives into the next session. Use HTTP rather than opening index.html directly because the app uses ES modules. No public deployment has been performed; GitHub Pages is the intended hosting platform.

**Browser preference:** use VS Code's integrated browser where possible. This session had no tool to automate it, so automated checks used an isolated headless Chrome session. Do not repeatedly ask the teacher to approve routine actions already authorised; follow any actual sandbox approval requirements.

Implemented:

- Puzzles, exam practice and constrained Python challenges, with type/focus selection and exact code entry.
- Marking, hints, model answers, retries and submission.
- Three selection actions: new set with another focus; different question combination within the focus; same questions with new variations.
- Optional 5–15-minute timer, hidden elapsed time, answer persistence, deadline recovery after refresh and single submission on expiry.
- Local progress, type/focus/date filters, history, score chart/table, revision priorities, CSV export and JSON backup/restore with duplicate detection.
- Click/keyboard controls for job ordering, device assignments, switches, drawing shapes, building paths and selecting spatial coordinates.

Current content: **27 active templates / 135 active variations**, five variations per template. Including retired spatial questions: **30 stored templates / 150 variations**.

| Type | Active focuses | Set size / marks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Puzzles | Number grids, spatial reasoning, logic, shapes, paths | Two questions; six or eight points |
| Exam practice | CA2.4 operators, CA2.8 validation | Three questions; 15 marks |
| Programming | Iteration, selection | Two questions; 12 marks |

The puzzle bank remains too easy according to the latest teacher review.

## Interface decisions to retain

- Show hint stays directly visible.
- To its right, a collapsed native details/summary container labelled **Check / show answer** holds Check answer and Show answer. When opened, it displays this exact reminder:

  “try to answer all questions first and submit your best try before checking correct answers”

- Disclosure state persists while interacting. Submission remains available without opening the answer controls.
- Submitted results appear **beside Submit as well as at the top**. Manual submission focuses the nearby result so students do not need to scroll to the top.
- The brand subtitle is two lines: **Digital Software Development**, then **T-Level**.
- Spatial questions use a **single clickable puzzle grid** showing the given marker. The second “new position” radio-selector grid was removed, including for old spatial codes.
- **Warm yellow means selected, not correct.** Puzzle selections use `#FFE6A0` with `#9B7122` borders. Reference shapes are purple; marked-correct feedback may be green. Retain text, symbols and pressed states rather than relying only on colour.
- New puzzle controls support click and keyboard. Shape cells toggle; paths support backtracking, Undo and Reset. Dragging is not required.
- Path marking accepts any route satisfying the constraints, not just the stored model path.

## Settled technical and curriculum decisions

- The teacher confirmed the curriculum **content is version 1.1**; older version references inside `../agents/spec.md` are stale. Preserve the source file and use 1.1 as the baseline. SAM files are in `../agents/SAM/`.
- Set codes use **Base64url**, case-sensitive alphabet `A–Z a–z 0–9 - _`. Eight characters encode 48 bits with no padding:

  `[version:7][type:2][question1:10][variation1:3][question2:10][variation2:3][question3:10][variation3:3]`

- An optional ninth character gives the timer duration: `5`–`9`, `A`–`F` for 5–15 minutes.
- Types: 0=puzzles, 1=exam, 2=programming; 3 reserved. Question slot 1023 denotes an unused trailing position, with variation zero. Active slots are 0–1022. Eight possible variations per slot; the bank currently uses five.
- Codes decode directly; no exhaustive set-code catalogue, question-text hash or shared seed is needed. Preserve case; reject standard Base64 `+` and `/`, invalid fields and invalid compositions.
- Slots are stable IDs, not array positions. Preserve existing code meanings; use new slots or a new retained bank version for different tasks. Curriculum version 1.1 and encoded question-bank version 1 are distinct.
- Original spatial slots 3–5 are marked `retired` and excluded from random selection. Old codes still resolve. New spatial slots 15–17 contain the attempted replacements, which the teacher also considers insufficiently challenging.
- Some AGENTS.md paragraphs still describe superseded six-character/hash/ASCII ideas. The explicit conversation decisions and the implemented Base64url specification supersede those passages. Do not revert to them.

## Verification at last implementation checkpoint

**22 automated tests passed**, and all 150 stored variation model answers passed bank validation. Tests cover codec boundaries and compatibility, marking, selection, deadlines, puzzle arithmetic, unique logic solutions, independent shape/spatial/robot reference calculations and alternative valid paths.

```sh
/opt/homebrew/bin/node --test tests/*.test.js
/opt/homebrew/bin/node scripts/validate.js
```

Node was available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/node` but absent from the default shell PATH. Python 3 is used for reference-code checks.

Browser smoke checks also passed: three activity types, scoring, history, refresh, timer expiry/deduplication, answer disclosure, nearby submission results, direct spatial selection, logic interactions, shape painting, keyboard arrows/Space, yellow selection colour, saved puzzle answers, alternative paths and 320px reflow.

`scripts/browser-smoke.mjs` expects the preview on port 8765 and an isolated Chrome debug endpoint on 9227. It **clears app storage in the test profile**; do not use a real student/user browser profile. Previous isolated profile: `/private/tmp/dsd-starters-pilot-browser`. Screenshots were saved as `/private/tmp/starters-*.png`; these temporary files/processes may not survive. This is not a full accessibility audit or cross-browser certification.

No tests were rerun merely to save this documentation checkpoint.

## Other outstanding work and limits

- Full curriculum coverage inventory and reviewed question bank are not built. Topic coverage is distinct from demonstrating every specified skill.
- Free-form Python execution, extended text marking and CSV import are not implemented. JSON backup/restore is the current history-transfer mechanism.
- Revision evidence is recorded at question level, not part level. Assisted first responses and puzzles are excluded from revision priorities. Final scores may include retries within the activity.
- Progress is browser-local; no accounts or OneDrive integration. One active activity per browser profile. Abandoned drafts are not retained as completed history.
- Classroom timing and difficulty calibration are unresolved. **Raising puzzle difficulty is the next content priority; do not treat it as completed because the interface and automated tests work.**

## Current session: coverage and puzzle recalibration (14 September 2026)

- The initial 106-question draft sampled numbered objectives and did not cover their constituent elements. This was a serious limitation, not complete CA1–CA2 coverage.
- Agreed coverage model: each official focus has permanent local letters; parts link structurally to `{focus, elements}` and display `CA2.1.1[a,b]`. Counts are generated, never hand-maintained. Reordering must not reassign letters. Count distinct questions, require two applicable variations, and distinguish supporting practice from direct assessment and teacher-approved coverage.
- New inventory: 106 focuses / 369 subelements. Current exam expansion: 51 live multipart questions, two variations each, spanning all CA1–CA2 subsections. Initial generated report: 235 elements with live questions, 14 practice-only, 120 uncovered; only 10 elements have two live questions. None is teacher-approved. Re-run the report for current counts.
- User authorises dropping old demo-code compatibility to prioritise clean, robust, maintainable implementation. Keep separate banks by activity type. Exam implementation and checks are still being completed; do not claim final verification yet.
- Reread updated AGENTS.md: numerical/maths, spatial, sequence, logic and example-derived types; subtype filtering is desirable. User clarifies students are 16–19 at A-Level-equivalent academic level.
- Inspected all nine local example images. Basic 1 logic is explicitly under-one-minute onboarding; it is not the difficulty target. Four-entity logic examples require linked exclusions, time differences and either/or reasoning; the harder example has four categories and eight clues. Tangram requires using every piece without gaps/overlap and may admit alternative solutions. Dot paths require visiting all dots, not merely reaching an end. Equation grids use cross/tick candidate marking. Sudoku needs candidate notes and deductions.
- The old arithmetic grids, direct transformations and three-item ordering examples in spec-puzzles must be replaced as production benchmarks. Larger grids and more clicks alone do not establish difficulty. New items need linked reasoning, independently checked solutions and student timing calibration.
- User now authorises implementation of five distinct puzzles per planned type, including all local example types, and asks to use the ready-made maths problems from the linked HTML collection where practical. Read source questions/solutions first; separate prompt from hidden solution. Do not treat the request as preparation-only any more.
- Linked sources: Mr Barton Maths puzzle collection; mathschallenge 1-star PDF; GoProblems; OGS collection 2625. Web reader exposes the Barton landing page but not its client-rendered problems; downloaded HTML for full review. Go content has not yet been inspected beyond its app shell. Record source-review limits accurately.
